Read / Write Lock Java Implementation
First let's summarize the conditions for getting read and write access to the resource:

Read Access   	If no threads are writing, and no threads have requested write access.
Write Access   	If no threads are reading or writing.
If a thread wants to read the resource, it is okay as long as no threads are writing 
to it, and no threads have requested write access to the resource. By up-prioritizing 
write-access requests we assume that write requests are more important than read-requests. 
Besides, if reads are what happens most often, and we did not up-prioritize writes, 
starvation could occur. Threads requesting write access would be blocked until all 
readers had unlocked the ReadWriteLock. If new threads were constantly granted read 
access the thread waiting for write access would remain blocked indefinately, 
resulting in starvation. Therefore a thread can only be granted read access if no 
thread has currently locked the ReadWriteLock for writing, or requested it locked for writing.

A thread that wants write access to the resource can be granted so when no threads 
are reading nor writing to the resource. It doesn't matter how many threads have 
requested write access or in what sequence, unless you want to guarantee fairness 
between threads requesting write access.

With these simple rules in mind we can implement a ReadWriteLock as shown below:
*/

/*
class ReadWriteLock{
	private int readers       = 0;
	private int writers       = 0;
	private int writeRequests = 0;
	
	public synchronized void lockRead() throws InterruptedException{
		while(writers > 0 || writeRequests > 0){
			wait();
		}
		readers++;
	}
	
	public synchronized void unlockRead(){
		readers--;
		notifyAll();
	}

	public synchronized void lockWrite() throws InterruptedException{
		writeRequests++;
		
		while(readers > 0 || writers > 0){
			wait();
		}
		writeRequests--;
		writers++;
	}

	public synchronized void unlockWrite() throws InterruptedException{
		writers--;
		notifyAll();
	}
}
*/

class ReadWriteLock{
	int writers = 0;
	int readers = 0;
	int writeRequests = 0;
	public synchronized void lockRead() throws InterruptedException{
		while(writers > 0 || writeRequests > 0) {
			wait();
		}
		readers++;
	}
	public synchronized void unlockRead() throws InterruptedException{
		readers--;
		notifyAll();
	}
	public synchronized void lockWrite() throws InterruptedException{
		writeRequests++;
		while(readers>0 || writers>0) {
			wait();
		}
		writeRequests--;
		writers++;
	}
	public synchronized void unlockWrite() throws InterruptedException{
		writers--;
		notifyAll();
	}
}

public class ImplementReadWriteLock {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
/*
The ReadWriteLock has two lock methods and two unlock methods. One lock and 
unlock method for read access and one lock and unlock for write access.

The rules for read access are implemented in the lockRead() method. All threads 
get read access unless there is a thread with write access, or one or more threads 
have requested write access.

The rules for write access are implemented in the lockWrite() method. A thread that 
wants write access starts out by requesting write access (writeRequests++). Then it 
will check if it can actually get write access. A thread can get write access if there 
are no threads with read access to the resource, and no threads with write access 
to the resource. How many threads have requested write access doesn't matter.

It is worth noting that both unlockRead() and unlockWrite() calls notifyAll() rather 
than notify(). To explain why that is, imagine the following situation:

Inside the ReadWriteLock there are threads waiting for read access, and threads waiting 
for write access. If a thread awakened by notify() was a read access thread, it would 
be put back to waiting because there are threads waiting for write access. However, 
none of the threads awaiting write access are awakened, so nothing more happens. 
No threads gain neither read nor write access. By calling noftifyAll() all waiting 
threads are awakened and check if they can get the desired access.

Calling notifyAll() also has another advantage. If multiple threads are waiting for 
read access and none for write access, and unlockWrite() is called, all threads
waiting for read access are granted read access at once - not one by one.
